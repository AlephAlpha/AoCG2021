Here `t` is the state of the current tile: `0` means octagon, `1` means square.

When the direction has length 1, we just set `t` to `1-t`. If the length is 2, we multiply `t` by `x`, so `0` remains `0`, while `1` becomes a polynomial. If `t` is a polynomial, `1-t` and `t*x` are also polynomials. So invalid states are represented by polynomials.

Finally, we take the derivative of `t`. The derivative of a constant is `0`, which is falsy. The derivative of non-constant polynomials are truthy.
