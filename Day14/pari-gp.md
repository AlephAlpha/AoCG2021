    (n,m)->[[lcm(Vec(concat(p,q)))==m|q<-s]|p<-s=partitions(n)]

Let `x` and `y` loop over the integer partitions of `n`. Takes the LCM of all elements in `x` and `y`, and checks if it equals `m`. Outputs a list of lists, which is truthy when at least one element is truthy.

Here I only list some facts about [permutations] (please read this Wikipedia page for the definition of the terms):

Here by "permutation" I mean a permutation of the set \$\{1,\dots,n\}\$.

1. Every permutation can be written as a product of 2-cycles (swapping two elements).
2. So a "program" in this question can be seen as left multiplying a permutation \$X\$, and right multiplying another permutation \$Y\$. Let \$(X,Y)\$ denote such a program. Applying the program \$k\$ times is just left multiplying \$X^k\$ and right multiplying \$Y^k\$. The "period" of \$(X,Y)\$ is the smallest \$k>0\$ such that \$X^kY^k=\operatorname{id}\$. Here \$\operatorname{id}\$ is the permutation that changes nothing.
3. Every permutation can be written as a product of disjoint cycles.
4. If we write a permutation \$X\$ as a product of disjoint cycles, then the order of \$X\$ (i.e., the smallest \$k>0\$ such that \$X^k=\operatorname{id}\$) is the LCM of the lengths of these cycles. The cycle lengths corresponds to an integer partition of \$n\$.
5. If \$k\$, \$l\$ are the orders of permutations \$X\$, \$Y\$ respectively, then the period of the program \$(X,Y)\$ is a divisor of \$\operatorname{lcm}(k,l)\$, but not necessarily equals \$\operatorname{lcm}(k,l)\$.
6. But when \$k\$ and \$l\$ are coprime, the period of \$(X,Y)\$ does equal \$\operatorname{lcm}(k,l)=k\ l\$. A proof can be found in xnor's answer on Puzzle SE.
7. If \$k\$ is the order of some permutation, \$s\$ a divisor of \$k\$, then there exists a permutation with order \$s\$. This can be seen from the fact that, if \$k\$ is the order of a cycle \$C\$, \$s\$ a divisor of \$k\$, then \$C^{k/s}\$ has order \$s\$.
8. If \$\operatorname{lcm}(k,l)=m\$, \$u\$ a divisor of \$m\$, then we can always find \$s\mid k\$, \$t\mid l\$ such that \$s\$ and \$t\$ are coprime, \$s\ t=u\$.
9. So if \$k\$, \$l\$ are the orders of permutations \$X\$, \$Y\$ respectively, we can always find a program \$(X',Y')\$ (not necessarily the same as \$(X,Y)\$) with period \$\operatorname{lcm}(k,l)\$.
10. So the possible periods of programs are exactly these \$\operatorname{lcm}(k,l)\$, where \$k\$ and \$l\$ run over the LCM's of integer partitions of \$n\$.
