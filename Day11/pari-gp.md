I think this is the simplest challenge so far.

If the length of the direction string is 1, you go from an octagon to a square or vice versa. If the length is 2, you either go from an octagon to another octagon, or from a square to invalid.

Here we use the variable `t` to store the state of the current tile: `0` means octagon, `1` means square. When the direction has length 1, we just change `t` to `1-t`. If the length is 2, we multiply `t` by `x`, so `0` remains `0`, while `1` becomes a polynomial. If `t` is a polynomial, `1-t` and `t*x` are also polynomials. So invalid states are represented by polynomials.

Finally, we take the derivative of `t`. The derivative of a constant is `0`, which is falsy, while the derivative of non-constant polynomials are truthy.
